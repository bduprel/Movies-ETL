# Movies-ETL

##Overview 
This assigment was to help Britta create a dataset that is automactically updated daily on movie titles and reviews 

##Process
This was accomplished my refactoring code from the module to update the dataset and reflect the needs of the assignment 

##Results 
The results created a table of the movies in the dataset as well as the reviews of the movies in that set so Amazing Prime customers are able to better select movies they would find interesting.
